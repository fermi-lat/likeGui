This code is provided as unsupported software for driving the
likelihood, obsSim, and dataSubselector applications, as well as ds9.
It was developed to drive these applications on Linux, and has been
ported to Windows, but it may still need work on both platforms (send
bug reports!).

Required software for both platforms includes Python 2.1 or later and
the xml.dom Python modules.

On Windows, one needs Mark Hammond's win32 modules, which come with
the ActiveState Python distribution
(http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/) or can be
downloaded from www.python.org (http://www.python.org/windows/win32/).

Notes on usage
--------------

* The .py files in this distribution should be placed in some
  directory lying in the Python path, e.g.,

> python
Python 2.2.3 (#1, Jun 20 2003, 13:57:38) 
[GCC 2.95.3 20010315 (release)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> print sys.path
['/u1/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages', '/u1/jchiang/python', '/u1/jchiang/plplot-5.1.0/tmp', '', '/u1/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages', '/u1/jchiang/python', '/u1/local/lib/python', '/u1/jchiang/HippoDev/hippodraw/python', '/usr/local/lib/python2.2', '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/plat-linux2', '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/lib-tk', '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages', '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/HippoDraw', '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/numarray']

  or in the current working directory.

* Before launching, the ST_INST and GLAST_EXT environment variables
  must be set.  The paths to all the executables are set using the
  code in findPaths.py which simply traverses the ST_INST directory
  tree, picking the out latest versions.  This means that you can
  update your Science Tools packages, and likeGui will try to use the
  most recent versions.
 
* If you forget to set PFILES, or want to change it mid-session, it
  can be set using "File->Execute a Python Command..." from the top
  menubar.  To set PFILES, enter

  os.environ["PFILES"] = "<full PFILES path>"

  and to unset it, enter

  del os.environ["PFILES"]

  With PFILES unset, the applications will look in the current working
  directory for the .par files.  To see what the CWD is use
  "File->cd..." (or more obscurely, enter 
  "print os.path.abspath(os.curdir)" in the Python command window).
  
* "Likelihood->Create source model..." from the main window menubar
  will launch a dialog box in which one can specify the "source
  region" as an acceptance cone about some location on the sky.  The
  input file should be a flux-style xml file, e.g.,
  $ST_INST/observationSim/v*/xml/3EG_catalog_20-1e6MeV.xml.  Hitting
  "OK" will result in all point sources with "celestial_dir" tags in
  that file being searched and included in the model if they lie
  within the acceptance cone.  "Likelihood->Modify source model..."
  from the main window menubar reads in an existing source model xml
  file, by-passing the "Source Extraction Region" dialog.

  After hitting "OK", a list box will appear with the point sources
  and default entries for the extragalactic diffuse and Galactic
  diffuse.  Note that the point source names from the flux-style xml
  file are modified by prepending "my_" to each name.  The numbers
  beside the point source names are the integral photon fluxes above
  30 MeV, assuming that they are specified in the input xml file as
  having power-law spectra.  For the diffuse sources, those numbers
  are the "Prefactors" in the spectrum power-law model.  

  The output file specified in the dialog box will contain the source
  model xml entries, readable by likelihood, for all of these sources.
  The "Save Selected" button will overwrite that file to contain just
  the selected sources.  By contrast, the "View/Modify Selected..."
  button will display the selected sources in a separate dialog box,
  but the source model xml file will be unchanged.  In this way, one
  can monitor and adjust by hand sources of particular interest while
  still retaining the complete model provided by the acceptance cone
  cut.

  The dialog box displaying the sources of interest allows one to
  alter source locations and adjust spectral parameters with radio
  buttons to indicate whether a source is free or fixed in the fit.
  Here are descriptions of its various buttons:

  "Save and Run" writes the changes to the xml file and launches or
  re-runs the likelihood calculation.

  "Save as..." opens a file dialog for saving the parameters after
  they have been adjusted or fit.

  "Reload" re-reads the parameters from the file.

  "OK" closes the dialog and launches or re-runs the application.

  "Cancel" closes the dialog without launching or re-running the
  application.

  If the likelihood application has not yet been launched, then
  commands that try to run it will open a dialog box allowing the
  values given in the likelihood.par file to be set.

* Since the helper applications are run under separate threads, one
  can in fact have serveral instances of the obsSim, TsMap, expMap,
  and dataSubselector applications running at once.  However, there
  can only be one likelihood thread running at any given time.

Bugs and misfeatures
--------------------

  The application captures the output for likelihood and prints it in
  the text window in the main screen.  To do this, it receives a
  carriage return to signal the reading of the next line of data.
  Some tasks performed by likelihood take a while to run and so will
  not generate a carriage return right away.  The computations
  themselves should be continuing just fine.

  Terminating a run-away process must be done outside the GUI.
  Killing a likelihood process may break the threading control, so
  restarting the GUI would be required.  The Helper Apps run
  ballistically in isolated threads, so killing them should cause no
  problems.
